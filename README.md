# NHL 94 Genesis

Bitwise rebuild of NHL 94 for the Sega Genesis.

The listing is `lst/nhl94.bin.lst`. The ROM it was generated from is `lst/nhl94.bin`. That file is the reference for every segment verify. Do not use a different ROM.

The listing is an IDA LST in ASM68K / MRI mode. It has no address column. `loc_` / `sub_` names are the address.

Style source for a segment is the matching file in [NHLPA93Genesis](https://github.com/abdulahmad/NHLPA93Genesis).

## Segment queue

`src/hockey94.asm` is the include list. `SEGMENT_AGENT.md` is the rule file. `PROMPT.md` is the first Copilot prompt. Placeholder files are comments only.

94-only files that 93 did not have:

- `attract94.asm` for `EASportsScreen`, `HiScoreScreen`, and `LoadDefMenuOptions`
- `sram94.asm` starts at `InitSaveRAM`

## Build

Segment builds use `buildseg.bat` and `npm run seg:<name>` once a segment has a stub and a confirmed org. Verify against `lst/nhl94.bin`.

`npm run extractassets` runs `extractAssets94.js` against `lst/nhl94.bin`. That is for the graphics and sound data pass, not for the code segments.

Full ROM builds assemble `src/hockey94.asm`. The opcode-corrected output is `output/modified_nhl94.bin`.

| Script | Flags | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `npm run build:retail` | `rev=0`, `checksum=1` | Retail, validation included, verified byte for byte against `lst/nhl94.bin`. |
| `npm run build:dev` | `rev=0`, `checksum=0` | No validation and no retail verify. Use this while editing. |

`build:dev` (`checksum=0`): `Start` skips `jsr ValidationRoutine` (3 `nop`s instead) and the header checksum at `$18E` is 0, so changed code still boots. With `checksum=1` the validation routine sums the ROM, and any change turns the screen red. `ValidationRoutine` stays in the ROM but is never called.
